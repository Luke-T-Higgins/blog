I'm currently studying Mathematics at Durham University. Throughout my course I have mainly studied Pure Mathematics, although I have enjoyed modules in Statistics, Probability, and Russian. I have a particular interest in Topology and Number Theory.
The 'Blog' section above contains all of my posts. Although these blogs are primarily mathematical, you will also find some other subjects explored.
